# Welcome!

<p class="usa-intro">This site provides an overview of the Dignari digital wallet design system, which is a finalist in the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&T) Digital Wallet Challenge.</p>

## Stage 2 submission

Since this website is serving as the main landing page for our final competition submission, we're going to cover our Stage 2 content first. Click [HERE](#competition-background) to learn more about the DHS Challenge and to see our Stage 1 submission.

### Our digital wallet design principles

Our design principles are aligned with the 5 principles outlined as part of the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/" target="_blank">U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</a> and serve as an overarching framework for our digital wallet design system and approach. **Fun fact:** We decided to use the USWDS when we built this GitHub Pages site. Since the challenge requested submissions consistent with the USWDS, we felt publishing our content using these established design standards demonstrated the value of open standards.

          aria-expanded="false"
          aria-controls="m-a1">

      </h2>
      <div id="m-a1" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
        <p>Our design system focuses on the end user (Subject/Holder) of the digital wallet rather than Verified Credential (VC) Issuers, Verifiers, or other system roles. We designed the User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) based on what we believed would be the most intuitive and effective experience for your typical end user.  </p>
        <p>To better define the digital wallet experience, we researched common use cases and evolving industry standards to gain a better understanding for how someone would use the wallet to not only collect and store their credentials but also to easily conduct secure transactions.</p>
        <p>As part of Stage 2 we attended multiple <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/" target="_blank">W3C Credentials Community Group (CCG)</a> meetings in order to understand the context for digital wallets so that we could take these into consideration for our design system. We also solicited feedback directly from the community when we formally presented our Stage 1 submission on 12/01/2020 to the CCG.

        <p>The resulting UI/UX consists of industry best practices and proven components, within a clean and modern design, and places privacy at the forefront of our funcionality.</p>
        <p>The delivery of our design system also goes beyond your standard end user and focuses on practitioners within the digital wallet community. Our goal was to provide resources that would be applicbale to designers as well as developers. To that end, as part of our Stage 2 submission, we are including artifacts such as Sketch and Sass files consistent with other established design systems such as the US Web Design System.</p>
        <p>This design system is intended to be a living resource and serve as a bootstrapping capabilty for the digital wallet community. We believe in using the tools and methods that are common in solution development and we are. Open source concepts were at the center of this approach and we designed our artifacts to be easily shareable and open for collaboration.</p>

## Competition Background

In September 2020, DHS S&T launched the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2020/09/08/news-release-st-new-prize-competition-user-interface-digital" target="_blank">Trusted User Interface (UI) Digital Wallet Challenge</a> to call "...on innovators to design an easy-to-use and trustworthy UI that improves the overall user experience (UX) and management of digital wallet-based credentials."

<a href="https://www.dignari.com" target="_blank">Dignari</a> responded to the challenge by combining solution architects from their <a href="https://www.dignari.com/emerging-technology" target="_blank">Emerging Technology</a> team and designers from their <a href="https://www.dignari.com/human-centered-design" target="_blank">Human-Centered Design</a> team. This combination turned out to be a great mix as Dignari was selected as one of the 3 finalists to move onto Stage 2 where the champion would be crowned.

Below you will find out more about our methodology, design process, submission, and project artifactsâ€”including the final desing package on GitHub.

## Stage 1

In stage 1 we were mostly concerned with understanding the state of digital wallets, their respective uses cases, and workflows as defined in the various standards bodies and those working on defining the future for digital wallet usage.

#### Stage 1 submission

The video provides an overview of our design approach as well as a demonstration of how a person would use a digital wallet to apply for a job. In this use case, our Jane Doe goes through the process to:

1. Get a Verifiable Credential (VC) of her college degree from the university that she attended
2. Get a VC from the US Citizenhip and Immigration Services (USCIS) for her Permanent Resident Card
3. Create a package containing these VCs and submit to the hiring employer for consideration of employment
